# Briose is a go fish game written in Phaser and Angular.

# It is a simple game that allows you to play against the computer.

# It is a work in progress and is not yet complete.

## NPM Instructions

To run the game locally, you need to have Node.js and npm installed. Once you have them installed, follow these steps:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Docker Instructions

To build the Docker image, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:
```bash
docker compose up
```
This will map port 80 of the container to port 80 on your host machine. You should then be able to access the game in your web browser at `http://localhost`.
